# news_app
Flutter project I created to study bloc architecture 

## Description

This is a simple app for viewing news and commentary from https://news.ycombinator.com/ .

I used bloc as the architecture of the application. I made two blocs. The first bloc is used for news data and headlines, the second is used for comment data. 

The application also has a cache where the data is added after a successful request to the api.
